Needed:
    -Fill out MOTD's (Mostly Redundant ones).
    -Actually test the new uninstall winstore spotify (core.install) ->> (Get-Item -Path 'C:\users\{YOUR USERNAME}\appdata\roaming\spotify\spotify.exe').VersionInfo | Format-List -Force ->> force set prefs to this value
    -Add descriptions for addons ['DESCRIPTION:' in extensions.js] ->> need to rewrite functions to be faster
    -Finish utils.screenshots(colorschemes)
    -Fix powershell tsl11 errors ->> [Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol =[Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12
    -When updating to latest addons, do the same for dribbblish release.
    -Overall refactoring of codespace, lots of redundancy and artifacts, comb through each line.

Optional:
    -Globals need desperate updating [on hold until spicetify sorts out its shit, just update comfy dark for now]
    -Rework naming of functions and their examples/usage
    -Make code easier to access for developers, explanations, formatting, splitting up long functions, etc.
    -Create prefs file as an end of the road fix for when its missing. Easily done as all the info prefs contains is in this installer.
    -Trim down patch notes to a bare minimum as not to clutter/find a way to add a dropdown
    
Fix:
    -Prefs restore hang ->> code rework in progress, manually setting prefs files spotversion entry
    -Better image scanning for backgrounds to make text pop
