Needed:
    -Fill out MOTD's (Mostly Redundant ones).
    -Download Addons from spicetify repo (Themes is already done)
    -Globals need desperate updating
    -Actually test the new uninstall spotify (core.install)
    -Background images and descriptions for addons ['DESCRIPTION:' in extensions]
    
Optional:
    -Create prefs file as an end of the road fix for when its missing. Easily done as all the info prefs contains is in this installer.
    -When updating to latest addons, do the same for dribbblish release.
    -Trim down patch notes to a bare minimum as not to clutter/find a way to add a dropdown

Fix:
    -Prefs restore hang (After restoring prefs it needs to open spotify to resync the last opened version) [could possibly just hardset it instead]
    -# WIDTH = round(33.85416666666666 * SCREEN.width() / 100)
    -# HEIGHT = round(41.666666666666664 * SCREEN.height() / 100)
    -# Start by finding the difference in percentage of two pairs of integers; 1920x1080 (screen size base) to 650x450 (Application size).
    -# The output numbers (33.85416666666666 for 1920 to 650, and 41.666666666666664 for 1080 to 450) are then used to scale up the final applications width and height.
    -# This means that larger displays, eg 3840x1440, scale up the applications x and y as if it was still being viewed on a 1920x1080 display.
