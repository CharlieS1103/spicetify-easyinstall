Needed:
    -Fill out MOTD's (Mostly Redundant ones).
    -Download Addons from spicetify repo (Themes is already done)
    -Globals need desperate updating [on hold until spicetify sorts out its shit, just update comfy dark for now]
    -Actually test the new uninstall winstore spotify (core.install)
    -And descriptions for addons ['DESCRIPTION:' in extensions.js] https://github.com/ohitstom/spicetify-easyinstall/commit/aeef0ca94ff8bf32a5587e3c1563b71343790a7b <- reference
    -Create function for above ^: utils.screenshots(type="themes" | "colorschemes") [returns list of paths to the images]
    -[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol =[Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12 <- add to the spicetify install [powershell bug on older versions]
    
Optional:
    -Create prefs file as an end of the road fix for when its missing. Easily done as all the info prefs contains is in this installer.
    -When updating to latest addons, do the same for dribbblish release.
    -Trim down patch notes to a bare minimum as not to clutter/find a way to add a dropdown

Fix:
    -Prefs restore hang (After restoring prefs it needs to open spotify to resync the last opened version) [could possibly just hardset it instead]
    -Prefs file needs updating after restore

MAYBE PUT A BOX BEHIND THE TEXT WITH IMAGES? would undo all my pixel checking but would be better
