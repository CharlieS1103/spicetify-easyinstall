Needed:
    -Fill out MOTD's (Mostly Redundant ones).
    -Download Addons from spicetify repo (Themes is already done)
    -Globals need desperate updating [on hold until spicetify sorts out its shit, just update comfy dark for now]
    -Actually test the new uninstall spotify (core.install)
    -Background images and descriptions for addons ['DESCRIPTION:' in extensions]
    -[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol =[Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12
    
Optional:
    -Create prefs file as an end of the road fix for when its missing. Easily done as all the info prefs contains is in this installer.
    -When updating to latest addons, do the same for dribbblish release.
    -Trim down patch notes to a bare minimum as not to clutter/find a way to add a dropdown

Fix:
    -Prefs restore hang (After restoring prefs it needs to open spotify to resync the last opened version) [could possibly just hardset it instead]
    -Prefs file needs updating after restore
