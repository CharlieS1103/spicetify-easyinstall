An open source installer for the github repository of spicetify. Only compatible with windows, this .exe (or .py) will install spicetify and a spotify version verified by me to work together onto your windows computer. 

# **Information:**
Both spotify and spicetify will be locked to these respective versions and will not auto update, keeping your spicetify working for longer. Every couple of months i'll update to the versions of spotify and spicetify that work together.

I would like to mention this in no way replaces the installation process recommended by spicetify on their wiki, its instead a fall back if you are unable to get the latest version of spicetify running no matter what you've tried. if you havent tried the traditional method i do not recommend starting here.

# **Features:**
* Downloads and installs spotify and spicetify

* Provides an easy way to uninstall spicetify

* Automatic downloading of all currently available themes and extensions, including blockthespot.

* Easy to use config modifier that shows you all available options, and can be ran both on initial setup or any time you want using the startup menu.

* Everything offered by spicetify

I would just like to preface that this could not have been done without spicetify and its incredible developers, and that my spahgetti code doesnt even scratch the surface of their genius. Please check out their github here: https://github.com/khanhas/spicetify-cli
